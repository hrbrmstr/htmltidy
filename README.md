`htmltidy` â€” Clean up gnarly HTML/XML

Inspired by [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37061873/identify-a-weblink-in-bold-in-r) and because there's a great deal of cruddy HTML out there that needs fixing to use properly when scraping data.

NOTE: Requires [`libtidy`](http://www.html-tidy.org/) and presently is super-basic (no way to set options and pretty much only does HTML)

`brew install tidy-html5` on OS X to get this to work. You'll have to do a bit more leg-work to get it to work on linux (`apt-get install libtidy-dev` on Ubuntu sticks the library in a `tidy` subdir off `/usr/lib` and I don't have a `configure` script setup yet).

**SEEKING COLLABORATORS**

This works enough for me to use in a pinch. It should be straightforward (but tedious) to:

-   enable passing options in a `list`
-   bundle `libtidy` *with the package* and get it to work on Windows, linux & MacOS as the library compiles on all three with the necessary tools.

The following functions are implemented:
